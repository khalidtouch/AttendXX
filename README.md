1. Take the attendance of the students in a class by having them register their biometrics into 
   the class teacher's Android device. This feature is designed to only work when the teacher 
   and students are in the school premises, thanks to Google maps and Geofencing -> 
   Single-device mode
   
2. Take the attendance of the staff in your organization by enabling each staff use his Android 
   device to record attendance entries simply by tapping their built-in fingerprint sensor. This 
   feature only works when the staff is in the work premises.
